# CharityML: Finding Donors

## Project Overview
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization based in Silicon Valley. Its mission is to provide financial support for individuals eager to learn machine learning. After analyzing over 32,000 letters, CharityML found that all donations came from people earning more than $50,000 annually.  

To expand their donor base and reduce mailing costs, CharityML is now targeting residents of California who are most likely to donate. This project involves building and optimizing supervised learning models to predict potential donors, maximizing donations while minimizing letters sent.
